# Problem Statement:

You work for a corporation that uses on premise solutions and some limited number of systems. With the increase in requests in their application, the load also increases. So, to handle the load the corporation has to buy more systems almost on a regular basis. Realizing the need to cut down the expenses on systems, they decided to move their infrastructure to AWS.

## Tasks To Be Performed:
1. Use the Route 53 hosted zone created in the assignment.
2. Route the traffic to an EC2 instance with an Apache web server running in it using its IP address.
